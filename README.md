[How the iPhone 14 Pro's New 'Dynamic Island' Works](https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island/)

Apple recently announced their new iPhone 14 Pro smartphones. One of the biggest changes is the removal of the notch; now, the iPhone has a pill and hole-punch shaped cutout at the top of the display. While I was skeptical when I was reading the rumors, a new hardware/software feature mix called *Dynamic Island* makes the most of that space.

*Dynamic Island* is an interactive space that allows for multi-tasking, live alerts, and more. One of the most impressive aspects of the feature is its adaptibility. The size of the *Dynamic Island* changes depending on the type of notification being shown. For instance, your running timer indicator will slink away seamlessly when you get a phone call. In my opinion, it's one of Apple's biggest engineering feats in years.
